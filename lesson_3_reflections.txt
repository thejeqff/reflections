When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This is best when multiple users are working on the same project from their own computers.
This is also useful if a person plans to work on the same project from multiple systems.
Finally, it can allow for collaborative work on a project, such as an open source project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This will keep git log clean so that only actual commit changes are being logged. It also ensures that unfinished worked isn't pulled.
Manual pulls also fit the rest of the model of git, where the user has control over saving and backing up.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
branches: allow for different versions of files to explore new features or bug fixes
clones: allows work to be duplicated to a new repository so that it can becomes its own project with affectnig the original repo
fork: allows another person's work to be cloned to your own repository to make changes without affecting the person's original repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This allows some working locally on their computer how far ahead they are of the remote. This keeps the programmer from having to guess
how far ahead they are. It's also helpful for the local git repo to know how far ahead of the remote it is and svaes time in finding
conflicts or changes when it fetches or pulls from the remote.
