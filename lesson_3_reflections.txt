When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This is best when multiple users are working on the same project from their own computers.
This is also useful if a person plans to work on the same project from multiple systems.
Finally, it can allow for collaborative work on a project, such as an open source project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This will keep git log clean so that only actual commit changes are being logged. It also ensures that unfinished worked isn't pulled.
Manual pulls also fit the rest of the model of git, where the user has control over saving and backing up.
